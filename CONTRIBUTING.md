# Contributing to Email Sentinel

## Setup

Follow the installation instructions in README.md to set up your development environment.

## TODOs

- Use Python async functionality, particularly for API calls
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Set up a `requirements.in` with `pip-tools`
- Consolidate EmailData imports to use src/email/models.py consistently
- Implement consistent error handling across email clients
- Add comprehensive type hints (Note: `"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict"` is set in `.vscode/settings.json`, but code needs adjustment)
